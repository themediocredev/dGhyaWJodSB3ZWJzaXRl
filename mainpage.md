# Hey, I am Thribhu

I am a 14 year old who just programs just for the fun of it/as a hobby. I make games, scripts, and work with linux, bash, macOS and windows.

I like screwing up systems and destroying the internals of computers. 

# My work:

## LTSS
Linux TouchScreen Surface, this bash script is designed to help with the installation of touchscreen on the Surface. 

This script has very easy ways to installing the required drivers by cloning repos, downloading and installing the required dependencies and installing it to the root of the system. It is designed for my model of laptop, the Surface Pro 7+ with Fedora 37 installed.

## surfaceBTM
(Currently in progress, requesting people to help out) The Surface Pro tablet family is a good tablet lineup, though Windows is not giving it the correct measures, so I and the communito have decided to take it into our own hands and create surface Better Tablet Mode. 

It takes inspiration from Samsung DEX from when you can switch tablet android mode to a desktop experience. Windows already has the desktop mode, and with WSA (Windows Subsystem for Android), we can make an android tablet experience.
